# Twitter US Airline Sentiment

Analyze how travelers in February 2015 expressed their feelings on Twitter.

The goal is to classify whether the sentiment of the text(present in the form of a tweet by someone) is negative, neutral or positive.

### About Dataset:

The dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment

In this project, analysis is performed on the above dataset and a classification model is created for predicting the sentiment of tweet, whether it’s positive, negative or neutral.

The repository contains two notebooks
- Analysis.ipynb: It contains the analysis, visualisations and conclusions made by analysing the dataset
- Classification_Model.ipynb: It contains the classification models and the results achieved.

We have used NLTK Naive Bayes, SVC and Random Forests for the classification Model. The results and accuracies are also compared.
